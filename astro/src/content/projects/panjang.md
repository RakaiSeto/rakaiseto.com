Ever using a link shortener? Now try the opposite. Silly innit? At first, so i thought. But then i realized, there're 2 types of link shortener: the ones that make the link shorter but with readable/customizable name, and the ones that just make the link a short string of gibberish.

This is just the second type and i made the link to be longer... Got it? Good.
