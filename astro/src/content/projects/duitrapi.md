DuitRapi is an uncoming project of mine for managing financial input and output report. The project is built using React.js and Node.js. Several features are planned to be implemented, such as:

- Financial input and output report
- Categorization of financial input and output
- Optional photo proof of transaction

The photo proof of transaction is optional, but it is useful for the user to be future reference. The photo is stored in AWS S3.
