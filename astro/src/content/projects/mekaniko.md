When i work at Ardora Cipta Kreasi, i happened to worked on an E-Commerce project using Laravel and Go. The project ended up not going to production, but i've worked on the backend and the frontend. The backend is built using Go and gRPC, and the frontend is built using Laravel.

The E-Commerce was designed to accommodate both client and admin usage. The idea was for big material suppliers (principal) to have their own portal, then the user can buy products for their usages.

<!-- Here's the link to the project: [https://mekaniko.com](https://catalog.nteight.com) -->
Unfortunately, i cannot provide the link to the project due to privacy reasons.
