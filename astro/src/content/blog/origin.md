## Introduction 
Ah yes, this will be my first blog post. And here I will tell you why I made this section in the first place. 

To be honest I'm not much of a yapper or a writer, but I do think that writing is an important skill, and I want to practice it here, because I want do it for fun. I will talk about several topics here, from my experience, my thoughts, and my ideas. I will also talk about my thoughts on technology, my thoughts on life, my journey as a developer, and my journey as a person.

## Chapter 1: B-B-But you're majoring in Multimedia!
Actually, my story started when I was in Junior High School. I was not exactly a role model student back then. I'm not that interested in my studies there, I just want to go home, play games, and edit some video of my gaming footage. That leads me to my High School application, where I chose a vocational high school instead of a traditional high school. I thought I would enjoy myself there, doing something I like which is editing videos. 

Who knows, in my first year there I found something that I like even more, Web Development. So there was a subject called Web Basic that I found very intriguing. I like it because I found it like playing a Lego puzzle, composing each element to be a full webpage in the end. From there, I found my first educational YouTube channel [Web Programming Unpas](https://www.youtube.com/webprogrammingunpas) and also my first educational website [FreeCodeCamp](https://FreeCodeCamp.org). I also started learning a little bit of Python even though I didn't end up using it much.

## Chapter 2: Start of my adventure
At my school, every 11th grader must do a mandatory Internship after winter break. My mom's friend ended up offering me an internship under the condition that I must be capable of using Golang, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, and Redis. It was an enormous opportunity, and I ended up taking it. At first, I was a bit overwhelmed, but I ended up learning a lot and was accepted for the internship. Â 

The internship turned out to be eye-opening. I learned many things there and also ended up getting my first job offer from one of my colleagues there. From that point, I realized that this was the path I wanted to take. I ended up majoring in Informatics, and I enjoy it very much.

## Chapter 3: The transition to full-stack
At first, I was exclusively a backend developer and I thrived at the role, but a project changed everything. The project needed a Laravel frontend on top of the existing backend, and I ended up being forced to transition into a full-stack developer. The transition was not easy (as I imagined), but I ended up enjoying it very much. I still lean toward backend development, but I enjoy the challenge of full-stack development. That's also why I challenged myself to build this website using Astro, a static site generator, and Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework.

Next, I want to try another JS frontend framework and I chose Vue for its simplicity and ease of use. I've made a mini project using it, check it [here](https://panjang.rakaiseto.com/).

## Chapter 4: What's next?
Enough of the past, let's move on to the future. What's next for Rakai? Well, I want to continue exploring JS frontend framework and also start learning Node.js as I found it to be a high-demand technology on the market. I also going to focus on searching for a job as a full stack developer and also a place to conduct my internship for my 6th and 7th semester. 

I think that's it for now, but I will update my journey in another post later. See you guys.
